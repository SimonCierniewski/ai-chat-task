## üéØ Overall Project Criteria

### Core Requirements
- [ ] **Real Integrations**: Zep + OpenAI actually called (no mocks)
- [ ] **SSE Streaming**: Continuous token streaming in Admin and Android
- [ ] **Auth & Roles**: Admin routes reject non-admins; JWT verified server-side
- [ ] **Telemetry**: Events written for each message; dashboard shows real data
- [ ] **Documentation**: README explains setup, deploy, and known trade-offs

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **TTFT < 350ms**: First token arrives quickly (EU hosting helps)
- [ ] **Memory Budget**: ‚â§1.5k tokens from Zep before OpenAI call
- [ ] **No Buffering**: SSE streams immediately, no batching

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **No Secrets in Code**: Only .env.example templates
- [ ] **CORS Locked**: Only Admin + Android origins allowed
- [ ] **JWT Verification**: JWKS-based, no round-trips
- [ ] **RLS Enabled**: Supabase Row Level Security active
